**A fork of [pctrade/end4-pC](https://github.com/pctrade/end4-pC)**, which is itself a fork of [illogical-impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) by [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4)

> [!TIP]
> **Want the whole desktop?** This repository is the Quickshell shell only. The Hyprland config, the installer and the guides that go with it live in **[hyprland-m3-desktop](https://github.com/guiloklex-hub/hyprland-m3-desktop)**.

## ✨ What this fork adds

- **Dock** — running/focused indicators, live window previews on hover, right-click menu (window list, new window, pin/unpin, close), mouse wheel cycles windows, and each monitor lists only its own windows.
- **App drawer** (`Super+Space` or the dock button) — search, pinned and recent apps, categories, drag an app to the dock to pin it; right-click to hide, rename, change the icon, see details or uninstall; install from the repos, AUR or Flathub.
- **Bar** — readable pills (text paired with each pill color), resource values with temperature warning, AI usage quotas (`ai-usagebar`), battery details; popups stay open while hovered.
- **Desktop widgets** — readable cards, a two-column layout that leaves the wallpaper free, shown only on the monitors you choose, media card hides when nothing plays.
- **Settings panel** (`Super+Z`) — reorganized Hyprland page (displays with a 15 s keep/revert confirmation, valid scales only, keyboard presets, mouse/touchpad in %), plus new Network, Bluetooth, Audio and System pages.
- **Lock screen** — clock and date, fingerprint keeps listening after a failed read and shakes on an unknown finger.
- **Brightness** — external monitors through DDC/CI, and the laptop backlight turns fully off at 0%.
- **Google Calendar agenda** (read-only, secret iCal links) and a complete **Brazilian Portuguese** translation.
- Fixes: GUI apps launched through UWSM, safer media artwork download, monitor config kept when a screen is unplugged, and more — see the commit history.

## ⚡ Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This fork manages its own configuration folder independently — it does **not** overwrite or modify any existing setup. However, it does require [illogical-impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) to be installed and running.

```bash
cd ~/.config/quickshell/
git clone https://github.com/pctrade/end4-pC.git
killall qs 2>/dev/null; qs -c end4-pC > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
```

### 🔧 Set as your default shell (optional)

If you like it and want it to load by default instead of `ii`, edit:

```bash
~/.config/hypr/hyprland/variables.lua
```

And change this line:

```lua
hl.env("qsConfig", "ii")
```

to:

```lua
hl.env("qsConfig", "end4-pC")
```

> [!TIP]
> After saving, restart Hyprland or run `hyprctl reload` to apply the change.

---

### ⚙️ Settings keybind

To open the settings panel, add this to your Hyprland config:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + escape", hl.dsp.global("quickshell:settingsToggle"), {description = "Toggle settings"})
```

> **Note:** Settings is an overlay panel, not a regular window — `Super + Q` won't close it. Use the same keybind to toggle it or press `Escape`.

---

## ❓ FAQ

### How do I see my keybinds?

Open the launcher (`SUPER`) and type `<` — it'll show you the full list of configured keybinds.

### Why doesn't Settings have a search bar?

It doesn't need one — the launcher already does that job. Open the launcher (`SUPER`) and just type what you're looking for (e.g. `wallpaper`, `bar`, `blur`); it'll match against page names and section keywords and jump you straight to the right Settings page, so there's no need for a separate search inside Settings itself.
